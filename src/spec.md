# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update Chimp Factory Hub’s look and behavior to match the provided purple swirl background, make all text purple, remove emojis from UI copy, and redirect the Home “Play Now” button to the provided Meta experiences URL.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a full-screen pink/purple swirl background image as a static asset and apply it app-wide behind all pages (Home and Privacy Policy), centered and cover-scaled without tiling.
- Adjust global styling so all user-facing text defaults to purple (headings, body, navigation, footer, and Privacy Policy), replacing any amber/orange gradient text treatments where they affect text color while maintaining legibility over the new background.
- Remove emoji characters from UI text/content across Header, Home hero area, and Privacy Policy headings/content, keeping meaning and layout intact.
- Update the Home “Play Now” button to open the provided Meta experiences URL as an external link using safe attributes.

**User-visible outcome:** The app displays a purple swirl background across all pages with purple text, no emojis in the UI, and clicking “Play Now” opens the Chimp Factory Meta experiences page.
